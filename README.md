Note: this does might not work on some sites becuase of the  Content Security Policy but it has worked well for me so far.  
Also Note: that the getfromdictionary.com bookmarklet uses a CORS proxy to try and bypass the cross-Origin Request Blocked error but still needs some twerking for proper funtctionality.
